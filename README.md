# Kaggle-Taxi
This is my kernel imported from the Kaggle competition New York City Taxi Fare Prediction: https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction

Used mostly as an exercise in data exploration, feature generation, and rudimentary modeling.

Current best submission ranked in the top 50/top 20%.
